ROS Turtlesim project demonstrating node execution and drawing basic geometric shapes using turtle motion control.
# 🐢 ROS Turtlesim – Drawing Geometric Shapes

This repository demonstrates a **ROS (Robot Operating System)** project using **turtlesim**, where the turtle is controlled to draw basic geometric shapes by publishing velocity commands.

The project includes a video showcasing the execution of the `turtlesim_node` and the drawing of multiple shapes.

---

## 📌 Shapes Drawn
- Square
- Rectangle
- Triangle
- Parallelogram

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **ROS**
- **Turtlesim**
- **Python (rospy)** / C++ (optional)
- **Linux (Ubuntu)**

---

## 🎯 Project Highlights
- Launching and interacting with `turtlesim_node`
- Controlling turtle motion using `/cmd_vel`
- Understanding linear and angular velocity
- Applying robotics motion control fundamentals
- Visual demonstration through simulation video

---

## 🎥 Demo
📹 Video included showing:
- Opening the `turtlesim_node`
- Sequential drawing of geometric shapes
